-----------Problem----------- 
# sealert -l lookupid--xyz

Summary:

SELinux is preventing clamd (clamd_t) "execmem" to <Unknown> (clamd_t).

Detailed Description:

[......]

SELinux denied access requested by clamd. It is not expected that this access is
required by clamd and this access may signal an intrusion attempt. It is also
possible that the specific version or configuration of the application is
causing it to require additional access.

 -----------Solution----------- 
# grep clamd /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M clamdav
# cat clamdav.te 

module clamdav 1.0;

require {
	type clamd_t;
	class process execmem;
}

# semodule -i clamdav.pp
